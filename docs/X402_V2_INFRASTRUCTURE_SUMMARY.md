# x402 v2 Infrastructure Migration - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Prepared By:** AWS Solutions Architect Team
**For:** Ultravioleta DAO Infrastructure Team

---

## TL;DR

**Infrastructure Impact:** Minimal. Most work is application-level (Rust code).
**Cost Increase:** ~$5/month (CloudWatch metrics)
**Deployment Risk:** Low (rolling deployment with rollback capability)
**Recommended Approach:** Dual v1+v2 support for 6 months, then deprecate v1

---

## Key Findings

### 1. AWS Secrets Manager: NO CHANGES NEEDED ✅

- All wallet keys remain unchanged (EVM, Solana, NEAR, Stellar)
- RPC URLs unchanged (premium QuickNode/Alchemy endpoints)
- No new secrets required for v2

**Action Required:** None

---

### 2. ECS Task Definition: ONE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE ✅

**Change Required:**
```json
{
  "name": "X402_VERSION_SUPPORT",
  "value": "v1,v2"
}
```

**Files to Update:**
- `terraform/environments/production/main.tf` (line ~479)
- `terraform/environments/production/variables.tf` (add new variable)

**Action Required:** Terraform update (5 minutes)

---

### 3. ALB/CloudFront: NO CHANGES NEEDED ✅

**Analysis:**
- v2 uses different header names (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` vs `X-PAYMENT`)
- ALB passes ALL custom headers by default
- No configuration changes required
- No CloudFront whitelisting needed (we don't use CloudFront)

**Action Required:** None

---

### 4. CloudWatch Monitoring: NEW METRICS ADDED 📊

**New Resources:**
- 7 CloudWatch metric filters (protocol tracking)
- 3 CloudWatch alarms (error detection)
- 1 CloudWatch dashboard (migration progress)

**Metrics Tracked:**
- `X402V1Requests` - v1 protocol usage
- `X402V2Requests` - v2 protocol usage
- `CAIP2ParsingErrors` - Network identifier parsing
- `V2SettlementSuccess/Failure` - v2 settlement operations
- `V2VerificationSuccess/Failure` - v2 verification operations

**Files Created:**
- `terraform/environments/production/cloudwatch-v2-metrics.tf` (ready to deploy)

**Cost:** ~$4/month
**Action Required:** Apply Terraform (5 minutes)

---

### 5. Deployment Strategy: ROLLING UPDATE (Recommended) ✅

**Approach:** Single ECS service supports both v1 and v2 simultaneously

**Advantages:**
- Zero downtime
- No infrastructure duplication
- No extra cost
- Easy rollback

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Deploy dual-support version
- Month 1-6: Monitor v1→v2 migration
- Month 6: Deprecate v1

**Action Required:** Follow deployment runbook

---

### 6. Cost Impact: +$5/MONTH (10% INCREASE) 💰

**Current Monthly Cost:** ~$44.60
**New Monthly Cost:** ~$49.60

**Breakdown:**
- CloudWatch metric filters: +$3.50/month (7 filters)
- CloudWatch alarms: +$0.30/month (3 alarms)
- CloudWatch dashboard: $0 (free tier)
- All other resources: No change

**Action Required:** Budget approval (negligible increase)

---

### 7. Backward Compatibility: FULL SUPPORT ✅

**Can v1 and v2 share infrastructure?** YES

**Shared Resources:**
- VPC, ALB, ECS Cluster, Secrets Manager, Route53
- Same domain: `facilitator.ultravioletadao.xyz`
- Same Docker image (dual support)

**Separate Resources:**
- CloudWatch metrics (different namespaces: `Facilitator/Protocol`)

**Action Required:** None (infrastructure reuse)

## Deployment Steps (Quick Version)

### Infrastructure Team (You)

```bash
# Step 1: Apply CloudWatch monitoring (5 min)
cd terraform/environments/production
terraform plan -out=v2-metrics.tfplan
terraform apply v2-metrics.tfplan

# Step 2: Update task definition environment variable (3 min)
# Edit variables.tf: add x402_version_support = "v1,v2"
# Edit main.tf: add X402_VERSION_SUPPORT to environment array
terraform plan -out=v2-task-def.tfplan
terraform apply v2-task-def.tfplan

# Step 3: Deploy to ECS (10 min rolling update)
# Wait for Rust team to build dual-support Docker image
./scripts/build-and-push.sh v2.0.0-dual
aws ecs update-service --cluster facilitator-production \
  --service facilitator-production --force-new-deployment

# Step 4: Monitor (24 hours)
# Open CloudWatch dashboard (URL in terraform output)
# Watch for CAIP-2 errors, v1/v2 traffic split
```

**Total Time:** ~30 minutes of active work, 10 minutes of waiting

---

## Rust Team Coordination Required

**Application Changes Needed:**

1. **src/types.rs:** Add v2 types (ResourceInfo, PaymentPayloadV2)
2. **src/network.rs:** Add CAIP-2 mapping (Network ↔ "eip155:8453")
3. **src/handlers.rs:** Version detection and routing logic
4. **Tests:** Integration tests for v2 endpoints

**Recommendation:** Invoke `aegis-rust-architect` agent for application-level implementation.

**Estimated Effort:** 12-19 hours of Rust development

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| CAIP-2 parsing bugs | Medium | Medium | CloudWatch alarms, rollback ready |
| Increased latency | Low | Low | v2 processing similar to v1 |
| Cost overrun | Low | Low | Only $5/month increase |
| Deployment failure | Low | Medium | Rollback procedure documented |

**Overall Risk:** LOW

---

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (24 hours)
- ECS service 100% healthy
- No CAIP-2 parsing errors
- v1 backward compatibility maintained

### Short-term (Month 1)
- v2 traffic > 10% of total
- Zero critical alarms
- No increase in error rate

### Long-term (Month 6)
- v2 traffic > 95% of total
- Ready to deprecate v1
